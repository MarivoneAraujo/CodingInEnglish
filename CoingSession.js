/* Let's practice our coding skills
Use any programming language 

1. Algorithm 1: Reverse a String
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns the reversed version of the string.
 For example, if the input is "hello", the function should return "olleh".

 2. Algorithm 2: Find the Longest Word
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns the length of the longest word in the string. 
For example, if the input is "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", the function should return 6 (for the word "jumped").

3. Algorithm 3: Counting Vowels
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. 
For example, if the input is "hello world", the function should return 3.

4. Algorithm 4: Palindrome Checker
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), 
and false otherwise. For example, if the input is "racecar", the function should return true.

5. Algorithm 5: Find the Missing Number
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers from 1 to n, where one number is missing, 
and returns the missing number. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 5, 6], the function should return 4. 

6. Algorithm 6: Find the First Non-Repeated Character
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and returns the first non-repeated (unique) character in the string. 
For example, if the input is "aabbccdeeff", the function should return "d".

7. Algorithm 7: Capitalize Words
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string. 
For example, if the input is "hello world", the function should return "Hello World".

8. Algorithm 8: Remove Duplicates from an Array
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers or strings and returns a new array with duplicates removed. 
For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 4], the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

9. Algorithm 9: Sum of Two Numbers
Write a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and a target sum, and returns a pair of numbers from the array 
that add up to the target sum. For example, if the input is [2, 3, 5, 7, 9] and the target sum is 10, the function should return [3, 7].

10. Algorithm 10: Check for Balanced Brackets
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string containing brackets (e.g., "{}, [], ()") and returns true if the brackets are balanced, 
and false otherwise. For example, if the input is "{[()]}", the function should return true, but if the input is "{[()}", 
the function should return false. 

11. FizzBuzz:
Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3,
"Buzz" if divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5. Otherwise, return the 
input number. For example, if the input is 15, the output should be "FizzBuzz." */
